const renting_apartment = `You: Hi, I'm interested in renting an apartment. Do you have a 2-bedroom, 2-bathroom unit available?
Apartment Leasing Agent: Yes, we do. That's great! When would you like to move in?
You: As soon as possible. Also, I'm looking for a place with a sauna. Is that something available in this unit?
Apartment Leasing Agent: Unfortunately, this unit doesn't come with a sauna. However, it does have a balcony. Would that be of interest to you?
You: A balcony works. Can you also check if there's available parking space?
Apartment Leasing Agent: Yes, we have dedicated parking spaces. Is one sufficient for you?
You: Perfect. Before we proceed, can you tell me about the nearby schools and shopping centers?
Apartment Leasing Agent: There's a good school a few blocks away, and a shopping center is within walking distance. Should I provide more details?
You: That's excellent. Now, let's talk rent. What's the monthly cost for this unit?
Apartment Leasing Agent: The monthly rent is $1,500. Does that fit within your budget?
You: I was hoping for something closer to $1,400. Is there room for negotiation?
Apartment Leasing Agent: I can check if there are any current promotions or discounts available. Please hold for a moment.
You: Sure!, Thank you!
Apartment Leasing Agent: Good news! We can offer you a reduced rate of $1,450 per month. Does that work for you?
You: That's more reasonable. Let's move forward. Can we discuss the terms of the lease agreement?
Apartment Leasing Agent: Certainly. I'll send you the lease agreement via email. Please review it, and if everything looks good, we can arrange a time for you to come in and sign.
You: Sounds like a plan. I'll review it and get back to you. Thanks for your assistance!
Apartment Leasing Agent: You're welcome! Feel free to reach out if you have any questions. We look forward to having you as a resident.`;
