const eco_tourism = `Ecological tourism, often known as eco-tourism, is a way of traveling that tries to take care of the environment. 
It means visiting places like forests, mountains, or rivers without harming them. 
Many people like this idea because it allows them to enjoy nature while helping to protect it. 
It can be a great way to learn about different plants and animals while making sure they stay safe.
One good thing about ecological tourism is that it can bring money to local towns and villages.
When tourists visit, they might stay in hotels, eat in restaurants, or buy things from local shops. 
This can help these places to grow and become better. 
It can also encourage local people to look after their environment because they know it's important for their business.
However, some people worry that too many tourists might actually be bad for nature. 
They think that when too many people visit a place, they might harm the plants and scare away the animals. 
Also, building things like hotels and roads for tourists can use up a lot of the earth's resources and make pollution worse. 
So, while ecological tourism can be good, 
it's important to do it carefully and make sure everyone involved really cares about nature. 
Otherwise, it might not help and could even make things worse.`;
