const renting = `Choosing between renting and buying an apartment is a big decision that comes with its own pros and cons.
Renting an apartment can be a good option for those who prefer flexibility and don't want to commit to a long-term investment. 
It allows you to move easily if you need to, without the responsibility of maintaining the property. 
However, it may feel less secure and could mean dealing with rent increases over time.
On the other hand, buying an apartment can provide a sense of stability and long-term investment. 
It gives you the freedom to personalize and modify your space as you like. 
However, it comes with the responsibility of maintenance and can involve a long-term financial commitment, 
including mortgage payments and property taxes.
The choice between renting and buying depends on personal preferences and financial situations. 
Some people prefer the freedom of renting, while others value the security and investment potential of owning a property. 
It's important to consider individual needs and goals when making this decision.`;
