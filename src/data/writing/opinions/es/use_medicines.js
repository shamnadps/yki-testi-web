const use_medicines = `The prevailing trends in modern healthcare often raise concerns about the overreliance on medications. 
With the increasing availability and accessibility of various drugs,
there is a growing apprehension that people might be using an excessive number of medicines.
This overreliance can stem from factors such as self-diagnosis, widespread availability of over-the-counter drugs, 
and the desire for quick fixes. 
Consequently, this tendency may contribute to the masking of underlying health issues and hinder the adoption of holistic approaches to wellness.
The advertising of medicines has long been a subject of debate. While some argue that it serves as an essential tool for raising awareness and educating the public about various treatment options, 
others raise concerns about the potential negative impact of marketing medications directly to consumers. 
The critical consideration lies in the balance between providing valuable information and ensuring that advertising does not promote unnecessary or inappropriate use of medications.
Certain ailments may not necessarily warrant the immediate use of medicines, 
as alternative approaches such as lifestyle changes, dietary modifications, or non-pharmacological therapies could potentially offer effective solutions. 
In these cases, the judicious application of non-drug interventions can play a significant role in promoting overall well-being and reducing the reliance on medications for managing certain health conditions.
Certain medications, particularly those with potent or potentially harmful side effects, should not be taken without a doctor's prescription. 
This practice helps safeguard individuals from potential risks and adverse reactions. 
Moreover, it ensures that medications are used appropriately, with a comprehensive understanding of the individual's medical history, 
existing conditions, and potential interactions with other drugs.
Considering the context of Finland, the prices of medicines remain a crucial aspect of the healthcare landscape. 
While high-quality healthcare services are widely accessible in Finland, 
the cost of medications may pose a challenge for some individuals, particularly those with limited financial resources. 
A balance must be struck to ensure that essential medications remain affordable and accessible to all segments of the population, 
thus promoting equitable healthcare for all.`;
