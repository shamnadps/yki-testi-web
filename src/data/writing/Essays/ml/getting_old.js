const getting_old = `Getting old can be challenging. 
As people get older, their bodies might not work the same way as before, and they might need more help with everyday things.
Some older people might feel lonely or sad because their friends and family are not around as much.
They might miss the things they used to do when they were younger, like playing sports or going for long walks.
Health problems can also make it hard for older people. 
They might need to take medicine every day or visit the doctor more often. 
This can be tiring and make them feel weak.
However, it's important to remember that getting old also has its good things. 
Older people have a lot of wisdom and experience, which they can share with others. 
They have seen many things in their lives and can teach others valuable lessons.
It's important for everyone to treat older people with respect and kindness. 
They deserve to live their lives with dignity and happiness.
It's also important for communities to provide support and care for older people, so they can feel loved and valued.`;
