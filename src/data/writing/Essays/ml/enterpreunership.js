const entrepreneurship = `People can choose to work for a company and get a salary or start their own business.
Both choices have good and not-so-good things.
When you work for a company, you can get a steady salary and benefits like health insurance and vacation time. 
You also have set working hours, which can help you plan your day. 
However, you might have less freedom to make decisions and do things your way.
Starting your own business can be exciting, as you can make your own decisions and be your own boss. 
You have the chance to earn more money if your business does well. 
However, it can be risky, as you might not make money at first, and you have to handle everything yourself, which can be challenging.
Each option has its own advantages and disadvantages. 
Some people might prefer the stability of a salaried job, while others might enjoy the freedom and challenges of entrepreneurship. 
It's important to think about what works best for you and your goals.`;
